# Pizza Sales Dashboard

## Description
I completed a data analyst project using Microsoft Excel and PowerBi to analyse data and create a dashboard to provide insightful visualisations for the stakeholders of a pizza company. This project involves extracting, profiling, and analysing the business' sales data. The focus of this project was to create a dashboard, and aims to provide insightful visualisations for better undertsanding and interpretation of the data.

## Installation
Raw Data:
	Pizz Sales Data Raw (Excel)

Clean data:
	Pizza Sales Data Clean (Excel)

	Pizza Sales Dashboard (Power Bi)


## Process
Data Importation: I downloaded all of the raw data from Kaggle, and then imported it all into Microsoft Excel

Data Cleaning: I then formatted all the data into a table, making sure all the columns are in the correct formats, that there is no missing data, there is no duplicated data which is not needed, and corrected any errors and inconsistencies within the data. 

Data Analysis: I analysed the data to create useful insights

Data Visualisations: I used several tools in Power Bi to create insightful visualisations to create an interactive dashboard that will be useful for the stakeholders.
